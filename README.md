- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnsmithimages
- 👀 I’m interested in coding for the computer generated images.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything of course though I do with my keyboard things Wolfgang Amadeus wouldn't have done with his. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding in Object Oriented coding. I know nothing of Python. C++ and Java are my tools.
